The natural land cover of the earth has been subjected to great changes over many years depending on human activities and different usage methods.

Large cities in developing countries are subject to a dynamic urbanization process because of population growth and migration. Since the acceleration of the urbanization process, settlement components that are built continuously cause significant changes in land cover and use.

These changes have a negative effect on the natural cover and #ecosystem. Therefore, regular follow-up of changes due to urbanization and detecting the current situation is important.

One of the most important image processing techniques in remote sensing science is classification. Utilizing the #Deep #Neural #Network binary-classification prediction with #remotesensing images, many use cases can be applied, such as land cover and usage purpose, water resources management, and change analysis.
